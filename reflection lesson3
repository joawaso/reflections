When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when i want to cooperate/share my work with others
  when i want make changes to the project from diferent locations
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  
  there might be unwanted changes made in the remote that you don't want in your local
