When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when i want to cooperate/share my work with others
  when i want make changes to the project from diferent locations
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?  
  there might be unwanted changes made in the remote that you don't want in your local
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  forks are clones but registered and are available only on github.
  clones are exact copies of repos either on github or on different local computers
  brnches are new versions of a repo for the sake of new feature or different mode
